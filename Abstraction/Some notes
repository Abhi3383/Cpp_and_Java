/*
Abstraction -> Abstract methods are such methods which will have only method signature which does not have any body.
            -> Abstract methods are those methods which will not have any implementation , which will not have any body only the method signature will be there.
            ->In Java in class we can have a methods without any implementation means we can have a methods without any body only the signature is there
                     for eg : public void fly(); // error - > not accepted without body
                            : public void fly(){ } //accepted 
                            : abstract public void fly(); // also accepted 
            -> Even if only method is abstract in class them compulsorily you have declare that class also abstract
                     for eg : abstract class plane
                              {
                                  abstract public void fly();
                                  public void takeOff();
                              }
            -> We cannot instantiate(object creation) object class.
            -> abstract - incomplete.
            -> abstract class can be child class it can never be final class.
            -> abstract method - no body only signature.
            -> abstract class - both normal body + abstract method
