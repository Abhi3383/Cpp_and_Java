1.  In PQ1 we have used 
    For 1st solution :2 pointer approach with while loop and set
    For 2nd solution :Set and for loop
    For 3rd solution :Binary search and set
2.  In PQ2 we have used 
    For 1st solution :2 pointer approach (in better and advanced way )
    For 2nd solution :Set and for loop (in better and advanced way )
    For 3rd solution :Binary search and set
3. In PQ4 target is to allocate all the books thats we returned false in "if"
