Initializer list
. For Initialization of non-static members
. For Initialization of refrence members
. For Initialization of member objects which do not have default constructor
. For Initialization of base class members.
. When constructor's parameter name is same as data member
. For performance reasons.

One way to put put values in Paramterized constructor is :
 class ABC
{
    int x,y;
    public:
           ABC(int a,int b){
            x=a;
            y=b;
           }
};

Another way of doing it using Initializer list is

ABC(int a,int b):x(a),y(b)
{

      //body

}

The lines in which we know we have to initialize like
const int y=5;
int &z = y;
ABC a1 = 5;
but the values can be changed or it should be through constructor so
we give this work to Initializer
