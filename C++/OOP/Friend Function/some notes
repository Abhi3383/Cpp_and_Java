ðŸ‘‰Friend function
â€¢ Friend function is not a member of a class to which it is a friend
â€¢ function which is friend to a class can access any member of the class (private , protected or public)

ðŸ‘‰Making a function friend to a class
â€¢ Function needs to be declared with friend keyoword in the class to which we wantto make it a friend .
â€¢ Friend function is defined outside the class without membership label ,as it is not a member function
â€¢ Remember friend function can be a member to another class ,so membership label is required while defining outside all the classes.
â€¢ You can declare friend function without bothering  access specifier because it is not a member, so no impact of access specifier on it.
â€¢ A function which is a friend to some class can be
â†’ a non member function ,or
â†’ a member of same class

â€¢ if friend function is an absolute non-member Function then you can invoke it like any other function
           functionName ( ) ;
â€¢ it friend function is a member to same class , then you can invoke it using objectof the class
          objectName.FunctionName() ;
â€¢ Member function can access properties of current object directly , but friend function needs an object to access its properties or methods
â€¢ A function can be a member to zero or one class and friend to Zero or many classes

ðŸ‘‰Defining friend operator

- friend Complex operator + (complex ,complex) ;
- friend complex operator - (complex);

ðŸ‘‰Difference between defining operator as a member and a friend

- Jab operator Ko as a member banate ho , tab jitne arguments dete no ,-Usse exactly ex jyada argument pass Karna padega agar friend
  banoge .Kyunki jo Kabhi caller object tha use bhi pass Karna padega

ðŸ‘‰Benefits of friend

â€¢ Function can be a friend to multiple classes , which makes it possible to access private members of multiple classes in the same functionality.
â€¢ With the friend operator it is possible to overload a binary operator in which left operand is not an object.
â€¢ various operators can only be defined using friend
