/*
ðŸ‘‰fstream -> ifstream -> read -> To use read we to create an object say fin
           -> ofstream -> write -> To use write we to create an object say fout

Had to tell fout in whixh file we have to read and write
so we call the open function using fout and write the full address of file

in          |    input          |      File open for reading: the internal stream buffer supports input operations.
out         |    output         |      File open for writing: the internal stream buffer supports output operations.
binary      |    binary         |      Operations are performed in binary mode rather than text.
ate         |    at end         |      The output position starts at the end of the file.
app         |    append         |      All output operations happen at the end of the file, appending to its existing contents.
trunc       |    truncate       |      Any contents that existed in the file before it is open are discarded.
