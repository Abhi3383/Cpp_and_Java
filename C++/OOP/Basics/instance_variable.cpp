/*

ðŸŒ•Members
a,b,setData() and showData() are members of complex

Memebers are of 2 kinds:
1) Instance members
->Instance member variables
->Instance member functions

2)Static members
->Static member variables
->Static member functions

->c1,c2 are objects.
c1 and c2 are instances of class complex.
a and b belongs to same instance of a complex class,
therefore k/a instance member variables.


ðŸŒ•Instance member funtions
-Functions defined in the class without static keyword are instance member functions.
-Instance member function performs object specific task.
-Instance member function can access any member of the current objet or called object.
- Instance member function can only be called for an object of the same class.
