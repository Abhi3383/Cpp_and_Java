Static variables - also called as class variables because of one copy of data among all the objects of class.
                 - common copy of data has to be shared among all object of class.
                 
Static block - If you want to execute something even before main method or during class loading itself for that purpose we use static block.
             - We also use it to initialize the value for static variables

-> We cannot access normal instance variable in instance block/method.
-> As as soon as the object gets created 2 things gets automatically invoked in back end.
1)Non-static block (First this gets executed)
2) Constructor (then this)
If there's non-static block in the code JVM will load that block into the constructor and it will execute first
after executing the body of non static block whatever actual body was there in the constructor that will be executed.

->Flow of code

-Static variable -> Static block -> Static method(main,disp2) 
     -> instance variables -> instance initialization block(non static block) 
                                              -> constructor -> method(non-static)

-> gets initialized during the creation of object - instance initialization block(non static block) , constructor

-> In the LaunchFarmer program
-As soon as the object gets created memory gets allocated in the heap area then according to the variables blocks of those variables gets created,
 main function works in heap area
